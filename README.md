# Stock Market Ticker Library
A custom library of custom logo and colors for tickers.

##
I like to override custom logos for certain tickers, as well as custom colors, so I created this repository so I can use it across projects without having to update each project individually. Feel free to use it. For any ticker not supported, I just use the follwing link, replacing {TICKER} with the ticker:
